          If there is one word that best sums up the state of fitness today, it's “personalized.” The reason is simple. Everyone starts different and everyone has different goals. Women want to lose weight, men want to build muscle and both want to look their best. No matter what your goal, be it weight loss or bulking up, you will have a hard time achieving those without a proper workout routine.

                Me and my friend have been having joint session with a professional trainer on Sweat4fit for the past 3 weeks. I can't recommend him enough, He listened to what we both wanted and has worked with us both to set our individual targets. Over the past 10 weeks he has learnt what both our strangths and weaknesses are and set us program for us.

                i have been training with Sweat4fit for almost a year now. Trainer has some good understanding of my training objectives and has consistently designed programmers that meet my aims. He strikes a good balance between pushing me, making me feel i can always achieve more than i think. He is always attentive through each session, and i very much feel i get value for money.
